# Special thanks

I would like to thank [Mario Zechner](https://twitter.com/badlogicgames) and the [libgdx](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) community for developing such an amazing framework to work with.
Also special thanks to [Aurelien Ribon](http://www.aurelienribon.com/blog/projects/universal-tween-engine) for creating a Java tween engine which can be used all over the place. This project also includes his work.
